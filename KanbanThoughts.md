title: Thoughts on Kanban and Queueing Theory
---

I have observed that a lot of people misunderstand Scrum.
Too often they do what has been called "ScrummerFall" or "Cargo-cult Scrum," the most common failing being taking their current process and merely applying the Scrum-ish terms to whatever they're doing now.

I'm seeing the same thing, if not more so, in Kanban, most notably when people claim to be doing Kanban but don't have any WIP limits.
I think it's worse in Kanban because queueing theory is so very counterintuitive.
Proof:  we have traffic jams, lots of them, all the time.
If we naturally understood queueing theory, that wouldn't be the case.

So, let's start off with a simple quiz:  which of the following are true and which are false?
1. **Shipping more frequently is the goal.**
2. **High team utilization is a good thing.**
3. **The more productive a team is, the sooner you can ship.**
4. **Projects will be more successful if you get them right the first time.**

I'll answer each of these as we go along, but if you want to see the answers now, click [here](answers1.html).
