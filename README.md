A [Kanban simulator](https://MiddleRaster.github.io/Kanban/KanbanSimulator.html), simulating being updated hourly, and calculating throughput and sojourn time. It shows the effect of lowering WIP.

Some thoughts on how counterintuitive queueing theory is, including excercises using the simulator so you can get a better feel for Kanban, queueing theory, Little's Law, etc.
